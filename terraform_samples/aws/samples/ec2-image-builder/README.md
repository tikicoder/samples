# terraform AWS Samples

This is a compilation of various terraform scripts I have wrote around various needs in AWS.

All scripts are covered by the MIT license, if you do want to use something in a closed source distributed manner where you make money please reach out.


Theses examples are using an experimental feature as of vrs 0.15.2, I am only using the optional attribute, hopfully it will be added soon
Optional attributes and the defaults function are
both experimental, so we must opt in to the experiment.
